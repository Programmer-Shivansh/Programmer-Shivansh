## üöÄ About Me

‚ö†Ô∏è **Due to a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), most of my repositories and work remain private.** My current engagements involve sensitive projects that require discretion, limiting what I can share publicly.

I am a dedicated software technician, innovator, and researcher specializing in **Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Full Stack Development, and Robotics**. Currently, I'm working on the prestigious **DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC)**, a project focused on advancing human-supervised robotic technology for disaster-response operations. This challenge, part of the U.S. Department of Defense's strategic plan, emphasizes developing robots capable of performing complex tasks in hazardous and degraded environments. I dedicate more than **75 hours per week** to this highly demanding and impactful project.

### Key Highlights:

- üèÜ **Multiple Hackathon Wins**: I've won several hackathons in the blockchain domain, where I developed innovative solutions that bridge the gap between decentralized technologies and real-world applications.
- üåç **International Robotics Competitions**: I've actively participated in numerous international robotics competitions, showcasing my expertise and contributing to advancing robotics technology.
- üî≠ **DARPA Robotics Challenge**: As part of Team UAS-DTU, I developed and implemented computer vision and deep learning models for UAVs and UGVs, focusing on human activity recognition, ODLC, visual servoing, audio classification, and health condition detection. I also created a full-stack GUI for real-time monitoring and synchronized control of multiple UAVs and UGVs, connected through an interop server for telemetry data, using Socket.IO for real-time operations.
